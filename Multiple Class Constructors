# In Python, the constructor for a class is defined with the __init__ method. Unfortunately, function overloading is not allowed, 
# and therefore we can only define one such function. However, there is a way to have methods that can be used similarly to 
# a class constructor. This can be done using the tag @classmethod.

# A new Date object can now be created by calling the fromString method:


class Date():
  def __init__(self, day, month, year):
    self.day = day
    self.month = month
    self.year = year

@classmethod
def fromString(cls, s):
   day = int(s[:2])
   month = int(s[3:5])
   year = int(s[6:])
   return cls(day, month, year) # Return a new object
   
d = Date.fromString("21/07/2020")
print(d.day, d.month, d.year)
