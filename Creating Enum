## Suppose you have in your program a variable that represents the day of the week. You would probably represent it as an integer, 
## so for example Monday is 1, Tuesday is 2, etc. However, this is not optimal, because you have to remember whether you started 
## with a zero or with a one. Furthermore, when you print that value it will be just an integer, so you need a function to transform 
## it into the correct name.
## Luckily, we can use the Enum class from the enum library. When you create a subclass of Enum , it contains a set of variables each 
## with its own values, that you can use in your program. For example, in the previous case you would write something like:


from enum import Enum
class WeekDay(Enum):
  Monday = 1
  Tuesday = 2
  Wednesday = 3
  Thursday = 4
  Friday = 5
  Saturday = 6
  Sunday = 7
  
day = WeekDay.Friday   ## set a variable to the value Friday

intDay = day.value     ## To get the integer value that Friday represents. This will be 5
